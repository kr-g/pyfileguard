King Arthur: "Look, you stupid b***ard, you've got no arms left!"Black Knight: "Yes I have."King Arthur: "Look!"Black Knight: "It's just a flesh wound..."

Black Knight: "Right, I'll do you for that!" King Arthur: "You'll what?" Black Knight: "Come here!" King Arthur: "What are you gonna do, bleed on me?"

[French soldier to Arthur]: "I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries..."

[Knights who say Ni to Arthur] "You must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest with...a herring!"

"What sad times are these when passing ruffians can say 'Ni' at will to old ladies."

"Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help! Help! I'm being repressed!"

"Who's that then?""I dunno, must be a king.""Why?""He hasn't got sh** all over him."

"We'll not risk another frontal assault. That rabbit's dynamite."

"Please. This is supposed to be a happy occasion. Let's not bicker and argue over who killed who..."

['Brave' Sir Robin] "I've soiled my armour!"

[Robin's minstrel, singing]: "Brave Sir Robin ran away. Bravely ran away away. When danger reared it's ugly head, he bravely turned his tail and fled. Brave Sir Robin turned about and gallantly he chickened out..."
